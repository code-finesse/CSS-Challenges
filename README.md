# CSS Challenges

## Welcome
CSS Challenges are a great way to grow as a developer and problem solver. This repo is designed to help developers see different approaches to common design challenges so they can improve!
<!--IF YOU WANT TO ADD A HOW TO APPROACH CHALLENGES SECTION -->
<!-- This repo contains two distinc sections to help you on your Css challenge journey: **Challenge Walk-throughs** and **How to Approach Challanges** -->


### Why This Repo Exist?

We are part of a daily CSS challenge group consisting of developers from many levels. We want new developers to have a reference for how to approach challenges as well as a solutions repo to view if they could not make the live challenge. This is that....

<summary>A note on walk-throughs</summary>
<br>
Walk-throughs are debrief of how we thought about and tackled the the challenge. These solutions are what we can generate in a limited amount of time. They are most often not the most efficient and responsive build. Those solutions can be found on the respective CSS challenge providers site or you can add them and a summary to this repo!
